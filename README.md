# ðŸŽ¨ EventProject UI Kit

This UI Kit is a collection of reusable interface components designed for an Eventbrite-style event web application. The kit follows the **Atomic Design methodology**, separating interface elements into small, maintainable HTML and CSS modules.

The kit is based on the **Mint** theme from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com), offering a clean and modern look built on top of Bootstrap.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of the UI Kit

- Ensure **design consistency** across all application pages.
- Create **modular and reusable components** using the Atomic Design approach.
- Make it easy to integrate the components into any future front-end framework or backend application (e.g., Rails, React).
- Maintain simplicity by relying only on **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap 5** (via Bootswatch).
